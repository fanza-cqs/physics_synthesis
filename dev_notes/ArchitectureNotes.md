## üõ°Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation Strategy**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Modular Architecture**: Each phase builds independently, allowing course corrections
- **Feature Flags**: Instant ability to disable problematic features
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only display high-confidence intelligence
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core writing functionality never depends on advanced features

### **User Adoption Risks**  
- **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers standalone benefits
- **Familiar Workflow**: Builds on existing Zotero integration users know
- **Optional Enhancement**: Advanced features enhance rather than replace core functionality
- **User Control**: Researchers maintain control over literature curation

### **Data Quality Risks**
- **Cross-Pillar Validation**: Triangulate claims across multiple data sources
- **User Correction Interface**: Allow manual validation and correction
- **Confidence-Based Display**: Only show high-confidence intelligence
- **API Reliability Scoring**: Track and adapt to external data source quality

## üèÜ **Unique Competitive Advantages**

### **Writing-First Intelligence**
- Only system that combines advanced RAG with writing-specific optimization
- Section-aware analysis tailored to academic writing workflow
- Context-sensitive literature suggestions based on writing goals

### **Three-Pillar Scientific Understanding**
- Cross-validation of claims across papers, authors, and institutions
- Physics-specific institutional and cultural context
- Career trajectory analysis for enhanced author credibility assessment

### **Curated + Exploratory Paradigm**
