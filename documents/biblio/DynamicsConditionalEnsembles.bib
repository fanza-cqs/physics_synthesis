We obtain upper and lower bounds on the expected distance of the output distribution from the ``useless'' uniform distribution. These bounds are tight with respect to the dependence on circuit depth. Our proof techniques also allow us to make statements about the presence or absence of anticoncentration for both noisy and noiseless circuits. We uncover a number of interesting consequences for hardness proofs of sampling schemes that aim to show a quantum computational advantage over classical computation. Specifically, we discuss recent barrier results for depth-agnostic and/or noise-agnostic proof techniques. We show that in certain depth regimes, noise-agnostic proof techniques might still work in order to prove an often-conjectured claim in the literature on quantum computational advantage, contrary to what has been thought prior to this work.Received 31 January 2022Revised 9 September 2022Accepted 31 October 2022DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.040329Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

We extract estimates for the associated bulk critical exponents that are consistent with the values for percolation, as well as those for stabilizer circuits, but differ from previous estimates for the Haar-random case. Our estimates of the surface order parameter exponent appear different from that for stabilizer circuits or percolation, but we are unable to definitively rule out the scenario where all exponents in the three cases match. Moreover, in the Haar case the prefactor for the entanglement entropies \$S\_n\$ depends strongly on the Renyi index \$n\$; for stabilizer circuits and percolation this dependence is absent. Results on stabilizer circuits are used to guide our study and identify measures with weak finite-size effects. We discuss how our numerical estimates constrain theories of the transition.},

Instead of directly measuring entanglement entropy, which requires an exponential number of measurements in the subsystem size, our method provides a scalable approach to entanglement transitions in the presence of conserved quantities. In analogy to entanglement entropy and mutual information, we illustrate how bipartite and multipartite fluctuations can both be employed to analyze the measurement-induced criticality. Remarkably, the phase transition can be revealed by measuring fluctuations of only a handful of qubits.},

The circuit exhibits a rich phase diagram involving robust symmetry-protected topological (SPT), trivial, and volume law entangled phases, where the transitions are hidden to expectation values of operators and can only be accessed through the entanglement entropy averaged over quantum trajectories. In the absence of unitary dynamics, we find a purely measurement-induced critical point with logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy, which we map exactly to two copies of a classical 2D percolation problem. We perform numerical simulations that indicate this transition is a tricritical point that splits into two critical lines in the presence of arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics with an intervening volume law entangled phase. Our results show how measurements alone are sufficient to induce criticality and logarithmic entanglement scaling, and how arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics can be sufficient to stabilize volume law entangled phases in the presence of rapid yet competing measurements.},

The approach is based on splitting a mixed quantum ensemble into pure subensembles, which according to quantum mechanics are maximally complete and irreducible. The splitting is done by filtering the outcomes of a measurement process. The approach is corroborated by comparing to relevant experiments in quantum optics. A critical review is given of two other approaches to fluctuations of work proposed in the literature. It is shown that in contrast to those, the present definition sid is consistent with the physical meaning of the concept of work as mechanical energy lost by the macroscopic sources, or, equivalently, as the average energy acquired by the ensemble; siid applies to an arbitrary nonequilibrium state. There is no direct generalization of the classical work-fluctuation theorem to the proper quantum domain. This implies nonclassical scenarios for the emergence of the second law.},

  abstract = {Starting from a state of low quantum entanglement, local unitary time evolution increases the entanglement of a quantum many-body system. In contrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees of freedom and decrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by considering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We begin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that measurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement, in contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary time evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement for any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show that more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law transition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with recent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we analytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit an entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size distributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed points.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on the order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any non-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an area law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that a system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law entanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which provides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement phase. Note: The results presented here supersede those of all previous versions of this manuscript, which contained some erroneous claims.},

We consider an ensemble of random quantum circuits, composed of single-site random unitaries and nearest neighbour couplings, as a minimal model of translational invariant many-body quantum chaotic systems. We evaluate the spectral form factor (SFF) as a sum over many-body Feynman diagrams, which simplifies in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension \$q\$. At sufficiently large \$t\$, diagrams corresponding to rigid translations dominate, reproducing the random matrix theory (RMT) prediction. At finite \$t\$, we show that translational invariance introduces an additional mechanism which delays the emergence of RMT. Specifically, we identify two universality classes characterising the approach to RMT: in \$d=1\$, corrections to RMT are generated by different translations applied to extended domains, known as the crossed diagrams; in \$d{$>$}1\$, corrections are the consequence of deranged defects diagrams, whose defects are dilute and localized due to confinement. We introduce a scaling limit of SFF where these universality classes reduce to simple scaling functions. Lastly, we demonstrate universality of the scaling forms with numerical simulations of two circuit models and discuss the validity of the large \$q\$ limit in the different cases.},

In this Letter, it is proved that a necessary condition for separability is that a matrix, obtained by partial transposition of \{rho\}, has only non-negative eigenvalues. Some examples show that this criterion is more sensitive than Bell\{close\_quote\}s inequality for detecting quantum inseparability. \{copyright\} \{ital 1996 The American Physical Society.\}},

  abstract = {States of a quantum mechanical system are represented by rays in a complex Hilbert space. The space of rays has, naturally, the structure of a Uhler manifold. This leads to a geometrical formulation of the postulates of quantum mechanics which, although equivalent to the standard algebraic formulation, has a very different appearance. In particular, states are now represented by points of a symplectic manifold (which happens to have in addition a compatible Riemannian metric), observables are represented by certain real-valued functions on this space, and the Schr{\"o}dinger evolution is captured by the symplectic flow generated by a Hamiltonian function. There is thus a remarkable similarity with the standard symplectic formulation of classical mechanics. Features such as uncertainties and state vector reductions---which are specific to quantum mechanics can also be formulated geometrically but now refer to the Riemannian metric---a structure which is absent in classical mechanics. The geometrical formulation sheds considerable light on a number of issues such as the second quantization procedure, the role of coherent states in semiclassical considerations, and the WKB approximation. More importantly, it suggests generalizations of quantum mechanics. The simplest among these are equivalent to the dynamical generalizations that have appeared in the literature. The geometrical reformulation provides a unified framework to discuss these and to correct a misconception. Finally, it also suggests directions in which more radical generalizations may be found.},

In such a theory of continuous measurements one can ask what is the state of the system given that a certain trajectory up to timet has been observed. The response to this question is the notion ofa posteriori states and a``filtering''equation governing the evolution of such states: this turns out to be a nonlinear stochastic differential equation for density matrices or for pure vectors. The driving noise appearing in such an equation is not an external one, but its probability law is determined by the system itself (it is the probability measure on the trajectory space given by the theory of continuous measurements).},

This places very strong constraints on the permissible modifications of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, since they have to give rise, at the statistical level, to a linear evolution for the density matrix. The derivation is done in a heuristic way here and is appropriate for the students familiar with the textbook quantum mechanics and the language of density matrices.},

We show that the latter case defines a one-parameter family of circuits, and prove that for a "maximally chaotic" subset of this family quantum information is scrambled faster than in the Haar-random case. Our approach is based on a standard mapping onto an averaged folded tensor network, that can be studied by means of appropriate recurrence relations. By means of the same method, we also revisit the computation of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions, re-deriving known formulae for Haar-random unitary circuits, and presenting an exact result for maximally chaotic random dual-unitary gates.},

It is also shown that all conceivable spectral and correlation-function information in output fields is accessible by means of an augmentation of the simulation process.

From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an entanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised measurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that lies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Moreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum information protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted. Because of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an overview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite programming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to address a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and applications. We also give a brief overview of some important results that are not directly related to semidefinite programming. Finally, we make available a collection of semidefinite programming codes that can be used to study the topics discussed in this article},

The classical de Finetti theorem provides an operational definition of the concept of an unknown probability in Bayesian probability theory, where probabilities are taken to be degrees of belief instead of objective states of nature. The quantum de Finetti theorem, in a closely analogous fashion, deals with exchangeable density-operator assignments and provides an operational definition of the concept of an ``unknown quantum state'' in quantum-state tomography. This result is especially important for information-based interpretations of quantum mechanics, where quantum states, like probabilities, are taken to be states of knowledge rather than states of nature. We further demonstrate that the theorem fails for real Hilbert spaces and discuss the significance of this point.},

In particular, we compute the exact value of the universal coefficient of the logarithm of subsystem size in the \$n\$th Renyi entropies for \$n {\textbackslash}geq 1\$ in this limit using relatively recent results for conformal field theory describing the critical theory of 2D percolation, and we discuss how to access the generic transition at finite on-site Hilbert space dimension from this limit, which is in a universality class different from 2D percolation.

We introduce a random unitary circuit model with intermittent projective measurements, in which the degree of information scrambling by the unitary and the rate of projective measurements are independently controlled. This model displays two stable phases, characterized by the volume-law and area-law scaling entanglement entropy in steady states. The transition between the two phases is understood from the point of view of quantum error correction: the chaotic unitary evolution protects quantum information from projective measurements that act as errors. A phase transition occurs when the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that depends on the degree of information scrambling. We confirm these results using numerical simulations and obtain the phase diagram of our model. Our work shows that information scrambling plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of entanglement in an open quantum system and relates the entanglement phase transition to changes in quantum channel capacity.},

This effect is, by itself, insufficient to produce generically quasi-classical behaviour of the Bohmian trajectory. However, it is shown that, if the system particle is initially in an approximate energy eigenstate, then there is a tendency for the Bohmian trajectory to become approximately classical on a longer time-scale.

This wave-function approach provides new insight and it allows calculations on problems which would otherwise be exceedingly complicated. The approach is applied here to a two- or three-level atom coupled to a laser field and to the vacuum modes of the quantized electromagnetic field. PACS numbers: 42.50.--- p, 32.80. --- t A typical model system in quantum optics consists of an atom coupled simultaneously to a laser field and to the vacuum modes of the quantized electromagnetic field. The atom-laser interaction, responsible for absorption and stimulated emission processes, is coherent, whereas the coupling between the atom and the vacuum modes, responsible for spontaneous emission processes, is fundamentally incoherent. This leads to a dissipation of energy from the "small system" (atom+ laser) to the "reservoir" (vacuum field), which is usually treated by a density operator approach. A master equation, usually referred to as the optical Bloch equations (OBE's), is written for the reduced atomic density matrix pz [1]. We present here an alternative approach using a wave-function treatment to describe the atomic system. The apparent incompatibility between such a wavefunction approach and the inherent irreversibility of the spontaneous processes is lifted by introducing repeated "gedanken measurements" on the atomic system simulating the detection of the spontaneous photons. The random result of each of these measurements determines the atomic state afterwards, and is at the origin of the irreversibility. We show that this treatment is equivalent to the standard density matrix approach leading to the OBE's. There are two main interests in this approach. First, it gives new insights into the processes taking place in the interaction of an atom with light. Here we will give two examples concerning the Rabi transitory regime for a two-level atom and the "dark resonance" problem. Second, it provides an efficient computational tool. If we consider an atomic system with N states, the master equation treatment requires the simultaneous solution of W OBE's, while in this new approach, we deal with wave functions and we have to look for the evolution of no more than W variables. For instance, in problems related to a quantum treatment of laser cooling, N includes both the number of internal and external atomic states and can be very large. This makes the density matrix approach unwieldy except for simple one-dimensional configuraI ttI(t+dt)) =I vr"'(t+dt))+},

Close to a quantum transition where the system develops critical correlations with diverging length scales, the competition of the two drivings is analyzed within a dynamic scaling framework, allowing us to identify a regime (dynamic scaling limit) where the two mechanisms develop a nontrivial interplay. We perform a numerical analysis of this protocol in a measurement-driven Ising chain, which supports the scaling laws we put forward. The local measurement process generally tends to suppress quantum correlations, even in the dynamic scaling limit. The power law of the decay of the quantum correlations turns out to be enhanced at the quantum transition.},

This theory has reached a stage where fruitful contact and exchange with physical experiments has become widespread. The present review is an account of the main mathematical ideas and their concrete implementation in analyzing experiments. The main subjects are the theory of dimensions (number of excited degrees of freedom), entropy (production of information), and characteristic exponents (describing sensitivity to initial conditions). The relations between these quantities, as well as their experimental determination, are discussed. The systematic investigation of these quantities provides us for the first time with a reasonable understanding of dynamical systems, excited well beyond the quasiperiodic regimes. This is another step towards understanding highly turbulent fluids.},

We explore the concept of implementing quantum measurements by coupling a many-body lattice system to an ancillary degree of freedom (implemented using two additional sites), on which projective measurements are performed. We analyze the effect of repeated (``stroboscopic'') measurements on the dynamical correlations of interacting hard-core bosons in a one-dimensional chain. An important distinctive ingredient of the protocol is the fact that the detector ancillas are not re-initialized after each measurement step. The detector thus maintains memory of the accumulated influence by the measured correlated system. Initially, we consider a model in which the ancilla is coupled to a single lattice site. This setup allows obtaining information about the system through Rabi oscillations in the ancillary degrees of freedom, modulated by the ancilla-system interaction. The statistics of quantum trajectories exhibits a ``quantum-Zeno-valve effect'' that occurs when the measurement becomes strong, with sharp branching between low and high entanglement. We proceed by extending numerical simulations to the case of two ancillas and, then, to measurements on all sites. With this realistic measurement apparatus, we find evidence of a disentangling-entangling measurement-induced transition as was previously observed in more abstract models. The dynamics features a broad distribution of the entanglement entropy.},

Here we investigate measurement-induced phase transitions in the Quantum Ising chain coupled to a monitoring environment. In particular we show that local projective measurements induce a quantitative modification of the out-of-equilibrium probability distribution function of the local magnetization. Starting from a GHZ state, the relaxation of the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic order is analysed.

The word  match  is short for stating that the  values  of the two observables in question determine each other uniquely and therefore (since the actual labelling is irrelevant) can be taken to be  equal.  In general there is but one match, but there can be more. If, in addition to the first match, there is a second one between canonical conjugates of the first mates, then there are infinitely many matches, every function of the first canonical pair matching with the same function of the second canonical pair. Thus there is a complete one-to-one correspondence between  those  two branches (of the two families of observables) which relate to the two degrees of freedom in question. If there  are  no others, the one-to-one correspondence persists as time advances, but the observables of the first system (say) change their mates in the way that the latter, i.e. the observables of the second system, undergo a certain continuous contact-transformation.},

If a system is open, there is a limit to the advantage in simulating its behaviour on a quantum computer, even when that evolution harbours important quantum effects.

However, recent technological advances mean we have control over systems at scales where memory effects are non-negligible. The lack of such an operational description has hindered advances in understanding physical, chemical and biological processes, where often unjustified theoretical assumptions are made to render a dynamical description tractable. This has led to theories plagued with unphysical results and no consensus on what a quantum Markov (memoryless) process is. Here, we develop a universal framework to characterise arbitrary non-Markovian quantum processes. We show how a multi-time non-Markovian process can be reconstructed experimentally, and that it has a natural representation as a many body quantum state, where temporal correlations are mapped to spatial ones. Moreover, this state is expected to have an efficient matrix product operator form in many cases. Our framework constitutes a systematic tool for the effective description of memory-bearing open-system evolutions.},

Indeed, in the classical realm there is by now a well-developed theory regarding such pseudorandom operations. However, the construction of such objects turns out to be much harder in the quantum case. Here, we show that random quantum unitary time evolutions (``circuits'') are a powerful source of quantum pseudorandomness. This gives for the first time a polynomial-time construction of quantum unitary designs, which can replace fully random operations in most applications, and shows that generic quantum dynamics cannot be distinguished from truly random processes.

The proof is based on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body theory, representation theory, and the theory of Markov chains. In particular we employ a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the spectral gap of frustration-free quantum local Hamiltonians; a quasi-orthogonality property of permutation matrices; a result of Oliveira which extends to the unitary group the path-coupling method for bounding the mixing time of random walks; and a result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing that dense subgroups of the special unitary group, composed of elements with algebraic entries, are {$\infty$}-copy tensor-product expanders. We also consider pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum circuits of small depth and prove that circuits of depth O(t10n) constitute a quantum t-copy tensor-product expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum many-body theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov, Arad, Landau, and Vazirani. We give applications of the results to cryptography, equilibration of closed quantum dynamics, and the generation of topological order. In particular we show the following pseudo-randomness property of generic quantum circuits: Almost every circuit U of size O(nk) on n qubits cannot be distinguished from a Haar uniform unitary by circuits of size O(n(k-9)/11) that are given oracle access to U.},

  abstract = {A quantum trajectory refers to the conditional state of a quantum system, conditioned on a time sequence of measurement records [1--3]. This state is thus dependent on a measurement history. The measurement record is a stochastic process. The source of the randomness is two-fold; it is due to the irreducible quantum fluctuations in the measured system, the source of the information, and it is due to noise added by the measurement apparatus itself. As the stochastic measurement record is accumulated, the conditional state of the measured system will undergo a stochastic evolution. If the measurement record is complete, and if the initial state is pure, the stochastic evolution of the conditional state can be represented by a pure quantum state, otherwise the conditional state is represented by a mixed state. A quantum trajectory thus connects a classical stochastic process, the measurement record, to a quantum stochastic process. We will primarily be concerned with continuous measurement, for which the measured system is always coupled to an environment from which information can be extracted. From this point of view there is nothing particularly new about quantum trajectories. The conditional evolution of a measured system has been considered by many authors [4--8]. Stochastic Schroedinger equations have also been postulated as a means to describe all open quantum systems, not just measured systems [9--11]. In this paper we will primarily be concerned with particular applications of the theory of continuous measurement for quantum optical systems.},

In the first case we find a crossover from area-law to logarithm-law entanglement scaling and draw the related phase diagram. In the second case we only find logarithm-law scaling, remarking the different entanglement behavior for different unravelings of the same Lindblad equation.

We demonstrate the application of this framework by deriving two types of memory-assisted uncertainty relations: (1) a monotone-based conditional uncertainty relation, (2) a universal measure-independent conditional uncertainty relation, both of which set a lower bound on the minimal uncertainty that Bob has about Alice's pair of incompatible measurements, conditioned on arbitrary measurement that Bob makes on his own system.

We find that non-Markovianity renormalizes the probability of realizing a quantum trajectory and that memory effects can be interpreted as a perturbation on top of the Markovian dynamics. We show that the diagrammatic structure is akin to that of a Dyson equation and that the probability of the trajectories can be calculated analytically. We then apply our results to study the measurement-induced entanglement transition in random unitary circuits. We find that non-Markovianity does not significantly shift the transition but stabilizes the volume law phase of the entanglement by shielding it from transient strong dissipation.},

The QET is a precise formulation of what we call normal typicality, i.e., the statement that, for typical large systems, every initial wave function \${\textbackslash}psi\_0\$ from an energy shell is "normal": it evolves in such a way that \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}psi\_t{$>$} {$<\backslash$}psi\_t{\textbar}\$ is, for most \$t\$, macroscopically equivalent to the micro-canonical density matrix. The QET has been mostly forgotten after it was criticized as a dynamically vacuous statement in several papers in the 1950s. However, we point out that this criticism does not apply to the actual QET, a correct statement of which does not appear in these papers, but to a different (indeed weaker) statement. Furthermore, we formulate a stronger statement of normal typicality, based on the observation that the bound on the deviations from the average specified by von Neumann is unnecessarily coarse and a much tighter (and more relevant) bound actually follows from his proof.},

In it, von Neumann studied the long-time behavior of macroscopic quantum systems. While one of the two theorems announced in his title, the one he calls the ``quantum H-theorem'', is actually a much weaker statement than Boltzmann's classical H-theorem, the other theorem, which he calls the ``quantum ergodic theorem'', is a beautiful and very non-trivial result. It expresses a fact we call ``normal typicality'' and can be summarized as follows: for a ``typical'' finite family of commuting macroscopic observables, every initial wave function {$\psi$}0 from a micro-canonical energy shell so evolves that for most times t in the long run, the joint probability distribution of these observables obtained from {$\psi$}t is close to their micro-canonical distribution.},

Here we study this phenomenon in an analytically tractable all-to-all Brownian hybrid circuit model composed of qubits. The system is initially entangled with an equal sized reference, and the subsequent hybrid system dynamics either partially preserves or totally destroys this entanglement depending on the measurement rate. Our approach can access a variety of entropic observables which are distinguished by the averaging procedure, and for concreteness we focus on a particular purity quantity for which the averaging is particularly simple. We represent the purity as a path integral coupling four replicas with twisted boundary conditions. Saddle-point analysis reveals a second-order phase transition corresponding to replica permutation symmetry breaking below a critical measurement rate. The transition is mean-field-like and we characterize the critical properties near the transition in terms of a simple Ising field theory in 0+1 dimensions. In addition to studying the purity of the entire system, we study subsystem purities and relate these results to manifestations of quantum error correction in the model. We also comment on the experimental feasibility for simulating this averaged purity, and corroborate our results with exact diagonalization for modest system sizes.},

The starting point is the Markovian stochastic wave function description of an open quantum system coupled to an environment consisting of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators in arbitrary pure or mixed states. It is shown that matrix elements of reduced Heisenberg picture operators and general time-ordered correlation functions can be expressed by time-symmetric expectation values of extended operators in a doubled Hilbert space. This representation allows the construction of a stochastic process in the doubled Hilbert space which enables the determination of arbitrary matrix elements and correlation functions. The numerical efficiency of the resulting stochastic simulation algorithm is investigated and compared with an alternative Monte Carlo wave function method proposed first by Dalibard et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \{{\textbackslash}bf 68\}, 580 (1992)]. By means of a standard example the suggested algorithm is shown to be more efficient numerically and to converge faster. Finally, some specific examples from quantum optics are presented in order to illustrate the proposed method, such as the coupling of a system to a vacuum, a squeezed vacuum within a finite solid angle, and a thermal mixture of coherent states.},

We consider different Hamiltonians that describe interacting, noninteracting, integrable, and nonintegrable systems, including random local Hamiltonians and translational invariant random local Hamiltonians. In all these scenarios, we find that the PCA complexity grows rapidly in time before approaching a plateau. The dynamics of the PCA complexity can vary quantitatively and qualitatively as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters and measurement protocol. Importantly, the dynamics of PCA complexity present behavior that is considerably less sensitive to the specific system parameters for models which lack simple local dynamics, as is often the case in nonintegrable models. In particular, we point out a figure of merit that considers the local dynamics and the measurement direction to predict the sensitivity of the PCA complexity dynamics to the system parameters.},

  abstract = {A laser, be it an optical laser or an atom laser, is an open quantum system that produces a coherent beam of bosons. Far above threshold, the stationary state \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{ss\}\$ of the laser mode is a mixture of coherent field states with random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number states. This paper answers the question: can descriptions such as these, of \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{ss\}\$ as a stationary ensemble of pure states, be physically realized? An ensemble of pure states for a particular system can be physically realized if, without changing the dynamics of the system, an experimenter can (in principle) know at any time that the system is in one of the pure-state members of the ensemble. Such knowledge can be obtained by monitoring the baths to which the system is coupled, provided that coupling is describable by a Markovian master equation. Using a family of master equations for the (atom) laser, we solve for the physically realizable (PR) ensembles. We find that for any finite self-energy \${\textbackslash}chi\$ of the bosons in the laser mode, the coherent state ensemble is not PR; the closest one can come to it is an ensemble of squeezed states. This is particularly relevant for atom lasers, where the self-energy arising from elastic collisions is expected to be large. By contrast, the number state ensemble is always PR. As \${\textbackslash}chi\$ increases, the states in the PR ensemble closest to the coherent state ensemble become increasingly squeezed. Nevertheless, there are values of \${\textbackslash}chi\$ for which states with well-defined coherent amplitudes are PR, even though the atom laser is not coherent (in the sense of having a Bose-degenerate output). We discuss the physical significance of this anomaly in terms of conditional coherence (conditional Bose degeneracy).},

A necessary condition for this is that the information carried away from the system by the bath (source of the irreversibility) be recoverable. The primary field of application is quantum optics, where the bath consists of the continuum of electromagnetic modes. The information lost from the system can be recovered using a perfect photodetector. The state of the system conditioned on the photodetections undergoes stochastic quantum jumps. Alternative measurement schemes on the outgoing light (homodyne and heterodyne detection) are shown to give rise to SSE's with diffusive terms. These three detection schemes are illustrated on a simple quantum system, the two-level atom, giving new perspectives on the interpretation of measurement results. The reality of these and other stochastic processes for state vectors is discussed.},

We provide an operational definition, from which we prove (by considering Werner states and isotropic states) that steerable states are a strict subset of the entangled states, and a strict superset of the states that can exhibit Bell nonlocality. For arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states we derive a linear matrix inequality that decides the question of steerability via Gaussian measurements, and we relate this to the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.},

The aim is not to deny or contradict the conventional formulation of quantum theory, which has demonstrated its usefulness in an overwhelming variety of problems, but rather to supply a new, more general and complete formulation, from which the conventional interpretation can be deduced. The relationship of this new formulation to the older formulation is therefore that of a metatheory to a theory, that is, it is an underlying theory in which the nature and consistency, as well as the realm of applicability, of the older theory can be investigated and clarified.},

The state space comes equipped with a natural Riemannian metric (the Fubini-Study metric) and a compatible symplectic structure. The operations of ordinary quantum mechanics can thus be reinterpreted in the language of differential geometry. It is interesting in this spirit to scrutinize the probabilistic assumptions that are brought in at various stages in the analysis of quantum dynamics, particularly in connection with state vector reduction. A promising approach to understanding reduction, studied recently by a number of authors, involves the use of nonlinear stochastic dynamics to modify the ordinary linear Schrodinger evolution. Here we use stochastic differential geometry to give a systematic geometric formulation for such stochastic models of state vector collapse. In this picture, the conventional Schrodinger evolution, which corresponds to the unitary flow associated with a Killing vector of the Fubini -Study metric, is replaced by a more general stochastic flow on the state manifold. In the simplest example of such a flow, the volatility term in the stochastic differential equation for the state trajectory is proportional to the gradient of the expectation of the Hamiltonian. The conservation of energy is represented by the requirement that the actual process followed by the expectation of the Hamiltonian, as the state evolves, should be a martingale. This requirement implies the existence of a nonlinear term in the drift vector of the state process, which is always oriented opposite to the direction of in creasing energy uncertainty. As a consequence, the state vector necessarily collapses to an energy eigenstate, and a martingale argument can be used to show that the probability of collapse to a given eigenstate, from any particular initial state, is, in fact, given by precisely the usual quantum mechanical probability.},

We apply the same method to the hybrid Clifford quantum automaton circuit and obtain similar multifractality in the volume law phase.

In particular, ensembles of such randomly-distributed, but pure, quantum states underly our understanding of complexity in quantum circuits and black holes, and have been used for benchmarking quantum devices in tests of quantum advantage. However, creating random ensembles has necessitated a high degree of spatio-temporal control, placing such studies out of reach for a wide class of quantum systems. Here we solve this problem by predicting and experimentally observing the emergence of random state ensembles naturally under time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics, which we use to implement an efficient, widely applicable benchmarking protocol. The observed random ensembles emerge from projective measurements and are intimately linked to universal correlations built up between subsystems of a larger quantum system, offering new insights into quantum thermalization. Predicated on this discovery, we develop a fidelity estimation scheme, which we demonstrate for a Rydberg quantum simulator with up to 25 atoms using fewer than 10{\textasciicircum}4 experimental samples. This method has broad applicability, as we show for Hamiltonian parameter estimation, target-state generation benchmarking, and comparison of analog and digital quantum devices.

This framework is valuable for analyzing properties of complex quantum systems such as energy spectra and the dynamics of thermalization. While contemporary methods in quantum chaos often rely on random ensembles of quantum states and Hamiltonians, this is not reflective of most real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective: across a wide range of examples, a single non-random quantum state is shown to encode universal and highly random quantum state ensembles. We characterize these ensembles using the notion of quantum state \$k\$-designs from quantum information theory and investigate their universality using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. In particular, we establish that \$k\$-designs arise naturally from generic states as well as individual states associated with strongly interacting, time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics. Our results offer a new approach for studying quantum chaos and provide a practical method for sampling approximately uniformly random states; the latter has wide-ranging applications in quantum information science from tomography to benchmarking.},

We discuss how orientability enters in the measurement framework, acting as a separatrix for the universal long-wavelength behavior in a circuit. When orientability is broken, the circuit falls into the universality class of closely packed loops with crossings (CPLC) and features a Goldstone phase with a peculiar, universal log2(L) scaling of the entanglement entropy. In turn, when orientability is preserved, the long-wavelength behavior of the circuit mimics that of (coupled) two-dimensional Potts models. We demonstrate the strength of the loop model approach by numerically simulating a variety of measurement-only Clifford circuits. Upon varying the set of measured operators, a rich circuit dynamics is observed, ranging from CPLC to the one-state Potts model (percolation), the two-state Potts model (Ising), and coupled Potts models (Berezhinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) universality class. Loop models, thus, provide a handle to access a large class of measurement-only circuits and yield a blueprint on how to realize desired entanglement phases by measurement.11 MoreReceived 7 July 2023Revised 9 October 2023Accepted 13 October 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041028Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

For efficient measurements the state is also purified; that is, on average, the observers' von Neumann entropy for the state of the system is also reduced by a non-negative amount. Here we point out that by rewriting a bound derived by Hall [Phys. Rev. A 55, 100 (1997)], which is dual to the Holevo bound, one finds that for efficient measurements, the mutual information is bounded by the reduction in the von Neumann entropy. We also show that this result, which provides a physical interpretation for Hall's bound, may be derived directly from the Schumacher-Westmoreland-Wootters theorem [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3452 (1996)]. We discuss these bounds, and their relationship to another bound, valid for efficient measurements on pure state ensembles, which involves the subentropy.},

Several arguments are advanced in favor of considering the quantum state description to apply only to an ensemble of similarily prepared systems, rather than supposing, as is often done, that it exhaustively represents an individual physical system. Most of the problems associated with the quantum theory of measurement are artifacts of the attempt to maintain the latter interpretation. The introduction of hidden variables to determine the outcome of individual events is fully compatible with the statistical predictions of quantum theory. However, a theorem due to Bell seems to require that any such hidden-variable theory which reproduces all of quantum mechanics exactly (i.e., not merely in some limiting case) must possess a rather pathological character with respect to correlated, but spacially separated, systems.},

  abstract = {The interplay of unitary evolution and local measurements in many-body systems gives rise to a stochastic state evolution, and to measurement-induced phase transitions in the pure state entanglement. In realistic settings, however, this dynamics may be spoiled by decoherence, e.g., dephasing, due to coupling to an environment or measurement imperfections. We investigate the impact of dephasing, and the inevitable evolution into a non-Gaussian, mixed state, on the dynamics of monitored fermions. We approach it from three complementary perspectives: (i) the exact solution of the conditional master-equation for small systems; (ii) quantum trajectory simulations of Gaussian states for large systems and (iii) a renormalization group analysis of a bosonic replica field theory. For weak dephasing, constant monitoring preserves a weakly mixed state, which displays a robust measurement-induced phase transition between a critical and a pinned phase, as in the decoherence-free case. At strong dephasing, we observe the emergence of a new scale describing an effective temperature, which is accompanied with an increased mixedness of the fermion density matrix. Remarkably, observables such as density-density correlation functions or the subsystem parity still display scale invariant behavior even in this strongly mixed phase. We interpret this as a signature of gapless, classical diffusion, which is stabilized by the balanced interplay of Hamiltonian dynamics, measurements and decoherence.},

  abstract = {The ability of quantum states to be in superposition is one of the key features that sets them apart from the classical world. This ``coherence'' is rigorously quantified by resource theories, which aim to understand how such properties may be exploited in quantum technologies. There has been much research on what the resource theory of coherence can reveal about quantum metrology, almost all of which has been from the viewpoint of Fisher information. We prove, however, that the relative entropy of coherence, and its recent generalization to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), naturally quantify the performance of Bayesian metrology. In particular, we show how a coherence measure can be applied to an ensemble of states. We then prove that during parameter estimation, the ensemble relative entropy of coherence (C) is equal to the difference between the optimal Holevo information (X), and the mutual information attained by a measurement (I). We call this relation the CXI equality. The ensemble coherence lets us visualize how much information is locked away in superposition and hence is inaccessible with a given measurement scheme and quantifies the advantage that would be gained by using a joint measurement on multiple states. Our results hold regardless of how the parameter is encoded in the state, encompassing unitary, dissipative, and discrete settings. We consider both projective measurements and general POVMs. This work suggests new directions for research in coherence, provides a novel operation interpretation for the relative entropy of coherence and its POVM generalization, and introduces a new tool to study the role of quantum features in metrology.

Based on a recently introduced resource framework, coherence can be regarded as a resource and be systematically manipulated and quantified. Operationally, coherence quantifies the intrinsic randomness of the outcome of the projective measurement in the system's computational basis. However, such a relation is only proven when randomness is characterized by the von Neumann entropy. In this work, we consider several recently proposed coherence measures and relate them to the general uncertainties of the projective measurement outcome conditioned on all the other systems. Our work thus provides a unified framework for redefining several coherence measures via general conditional entropies. Based on the relation, we numerically calculate the coherence measures via semi-definite programming. Furthermore, we discuss the operational meaning of the unified definition. Our result highlights the close relation between single partite coherence and bipartite quantum correlation.},

First, we study analytically and numerically the growth of the entanglement entropy of the system, showing that two different time scales appear: one is intrinsic to the internal dynamics (the scrambling time), while the other depends on the system-environment coupling. In the presence of a U(1) conserved charge, we show that the entanglement follows a Page-like behavior in time: it begins to decrease in the middle stage of the ``evaporation'', and decreases monotonically afterwards. Second, we study the time needed to retrieve information initially injected in the system from measurements on the environment qudits. Based on explicit numerical computations, we characterize such time both when the retriever has control over the initial configuration or not, showing that different scales appear in the two cases.},

Moreover, atoms can strongly couple to external forces and fields, which makes them ideal for ultraprecise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating nonclassical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements.

Randomness in the circuit elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice models or dynamical processes.

While entanglement is an important resource, only a subset of entangled states have negative conditional von Neumann entropy. Despite this utility, a proper resource theory for conditional von Neumann entropy has not been developed, unlike that of entanglement. We pave the way for such a resource theory by characterizing the class of free states (density matrices having non-negative conditional von Neumann entropy) as convex and compact. This allows us to prove the existence of a Hermitian operator (a witness) for the detection of states having negative conditional entropy for bipartite systems in arbitrary dimensions. We construct a family of such witnesses and prove that the expectation value of any of them in a state is an upper bound to the conditional entropy of the state. We pose the problem of obtaining a tight upper bound to the set of conditional entropies of states in which an operator gives the same expectation value as a convex optimization problem. We solve it numerically for a two qubit case and find that this enhances the usefulness of our witnesses. We also find that for a particular witness, the estimated tight upper bound matches the value of conditional entropy for Werner states. We explicate the utility of our work in the detection of useful states in the above-mentioned protocols.},

In both cases, the resultant ensembles are defined by a simple principle: The distributions of pure states have maximum entropy, subject to constraints such as energy conservation, and effective constraints imposed by thermalization. We present and numerically verify quantifiable signatures of this principle by deriving explicit formulas for all statistical moments of the ensembles, proving the necessary and sufficient conditions for such universality under widely accepted assumptions, and describing their measurable consequences in experiments. We further discuss information-theoretic implications of the universality: Our ensembles have maximal information content while being maximally difficult to interrogate, establishing that generic quantum state ensembles that occur in nature hide (scramble) information as strongly as possible. Our results generalize the notions of Hilbert-space ergodicity to time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics and deep thermalization from infinite to finite effective temperature. Our work presents new perspectives to characterize and understand universal behaviors of quantum dynamics using statistical and information-theoretic tools.

In contrast, numerous recent proposals have illustrated that dissipation can also be tailored to stabilize many-body entangled quantum states. While the focus of these works has been primarily on engineering the non-equilibrium steady state, we investigate the build-up of entanglement in the quantum trajectories. Specifically, we analyze the competition between two different dissipation channels arising from two incompatible continuous monitoring protocols. The first protocol locks the phase of neighboring sites upon registering a quantum jump, thereby generating a long-range entanglement through the system, while the second one destroys the coherence via dephasing mechanism. By studying the unraveling of stochastic quantum trajectories associated with the continuous monitoring protocols, we present a transition for the scaling of the averaged trajectory entanglement entropies, from critical scaling to area-law behavior. Our work provides novel insights into the occurrence of a measurement-induced phase transition within a continuous monitoring protocol.},

A major hurdle toward experimentally realizing this physics is the need to apply {\textbackslash}emph\{postselection\} on random measurement outcomes in order to repeatedly prepare a given output state, resulting in an exponential overhead. We propose a method to sidestep this issue in a wide class of non-unitary circuits by taking advantage of {\textbackslash}emph\{spacetime duality\}. This method maps the purification dynamics of a mixed state under non-unitary evolution onto a particular correlation function in an associated unitary circuit. This translates to an operational protocol which could be straightforwardly implemented on a digital quantum simulator. We discuss the signatures of different entanglement phases, and demonstrate examples via numerical simulations. With minor modifications, the proposed protocol allows measurement of the purity of arbitrary subsystems, which could shed light on the properties of the quantum error correcting code formed by the mixed phase in this class of hybrid dynamics.},

  abstract = {Unitary circuits subject to repeated projective measurements can undergo an entanglement phase transition (EPT) as a function of the measurement rate. This transition is generally understood in terms of a competition between the scrambling effects of unitary dynamics and the disentangling effects of measurements. We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence of scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from measurements alone. This motivates us to introduce {\textbackslash}emph\{measurement-only models\}, in which the "scrambling" and "un-scrambling" effects driving the EPT are fundamentally intertwined and cannot be attributed to physically distinct processes. This represents a novel form of an EPT, conceptually distinct from that in hybrid unitary-projective circuits. We explore the entanglement phase diagrams, critical points, and quantum code properties of some of these measurement-only models. We find that the principle driving the EPTs in these models is {\textbackslash}emph\{frustration\}, or mutual incompatibility, of the measurements. Suprisingly, an entangling (volume-law) phase is the generic outcome when measuring sufficiently long but still local (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$-body) operators. We identify a class of exceptions to this behavior ("bipartite ensembles") which cannot sustain an entangling phase, but display dual area-law phases, possibly with different kinds of quantum order, separated by self-dual critical points. Finally, we introduce a measure of information spreading in dynamics with measurements and use it to demonstrate the emergence of a statistical light-cone, despite the non-locality inherent to quantum measurements.},

While there exist quantum circuit models of dynamics in one dimension where this phenomenon can be shown to arise exactly, these are special in that deep thermalization occurs at precisely the same time as regular thermalization. Here, we present an exactly-solvable model of chaotic dynamics where the two processes can be shown to occur over different time scales. The model is composed of a finite subsystem coupled to an infinite random-matrix bath through a small constriction, and highlights the role of locality and imperfect thermalization in constraining the formation of such universal wavefunction distributions.

These models have shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena with no traditional analog, such as dynamical phase transitions in quantum systems that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more structured many-body dynamics.},

However, beyond a critical power law, we demonstrate that long-range interactions give rise to a continuum of nonconformal universality classes, with continuously varying critical exponents. We numerically determine the phase diagram for a one-dimensional, long-range-interacting hybrid circuit model as a function of the power-law exponent and the measurement rate. Finally, by using an analytic mapping to a long-range quantum Ising model, we provide a theoretical understanding for the critical power law.},

This approach is then used to obtain a classical model for the electronic degrees of freedom in a molecular collision system, and the combination of this with the usual classical description of the heavy particle (i.e., nuclear) motion provides a completely classical model for the electronic and heavy particle degrees of freedom. The resulting equations of motion are shown to be equivalent to describing the electronic degrees of freedom by the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation, the time dependence arising from the classical motion of the nuclei, the trajectory of which is determined by the quantum mechanical average (i.e., Ehrenfest) force on the nuclei. Quantizing the system via classical S-matrix theory is shown to provide a dynamically consistent description of nonadiabatic collision processes; i.e., different electronic transitions have different heavy particle trajectories and, for example, the total energy of the electronic and heavy particle degrees of freedom is conserved. Application of this classical model for the electronic degrees of freedom (plus classical S-matrix theory) to the two-state model problem shows that the approach provides a good description of the electronic dynamics.},

For many-particle systems, the competition of these different elements of dynamics can give rise to a scenario similar to quantum phase transitions. To access it despite the randomness of single quantum trajectories, we construct an \$n\$-replica Keldysh field theory for the ensemble average of the \$n\$-th moment of the trajectory projector. A key finding is that this field theory decouples into one set of degrees of freedom that heats up indefinitely, while \$n-1\$ others can be cast into the form of pure state evolutions generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This decoupling is exact for free theories, and useful for interacting ones. In particular, we study locally measured Dirac fermions in \$(1+1)\$ dimensions, which can be bosonized to a monitored interacting Luttinger liquid at long wavelengths. For this model, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian corresponds to a quantum Sine-Gordon model with complex coefficients. A renormalization group analysis reveals a gapless critical phase with logarithmic entanglement entropy growth, and a gapped area law phase, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The physical picture emerging here is a pinning of the trajectory wave function into eigenstates of the measurement operators upon increasing the monitoring rate.},

When it comes to quantum stochastic processes, however, the topic is plagued with pathological issues that have led to fierce debates amongst researchers. Recent developments have begun to untangle these issues and paved the way for generalizing the theory of classical stochastic processes to the quantum domain without ambiguities. This tutorial details the structure of quantum stochastic processes, in terms of the modern language of quantum combs, and is aimed at students in quantum physics and quantum information theory. We begin with the basics of classical stochastic processes and generalize the same ideas to the quantum domain. Along the way, we discuss the subtle structure of quantum physics that has led to troubles in forming an overarching theory for quantum stochastic processes. We close the tutorial by laying out many exciting problems that lie ahead in this branch of science.},

This quantity is a measure of the average mixedness of A after such measurement, and its minimum over all local measurements is shown to be the associated entanglement of formation between A and a purifying third system C. In the case of the von Neumann entropy, this minimum determines also the quantum discord. For classically correlated states and mixtures of a pure state with the maximally mixed state, we show that the minimizing measurement can be determined analytically and is universal, i.e., the same for all concave forms. While these properties no longer hold for general states, we also show that in the special case of the linear entropy, an explicit expression for the associated conditional entropy can be obtained, whose minimum among projective measurements in a general qudit--qubit state can be determined analytically, in terms of the largest eigenvalue of a simple 3 {\texttimes} 3 correlation matrix. Such minimum determines the maximum conditional purity of A, and the associated minimizing measurement is shown to be also universal in the vicinity of maximal mixedness. Results for X states, including typical reduced states of spin pairs in XY chains at weak and strong transverse fields, are also provided and indicate that the measurements minimizing the von Neumann and linear conditional entropies are typically coincident in these states, being determined essentially by the main correlation. They can differ, however, substantially from that minimizing the geometric discord.},

This entropy measures the average conditional mixedness of the post-measurement state of the qudit, and its minimum among all local measurements represents a generalized entanglement of formation. In the case of the von Neumann entropy, it is directly related to the quantum discord. It is shown that at the lowest non-trivial order, the problem reduces to the minimization of a quadratic form determined by the correlation tensor of the system, the Bloch vector of the qubit and the local concavity of the entropy, requiring just the diagonalization of a \$3{\textbackslash}times 3\$ matrix. A simple geometrical picture in terms of an associated correlation ellipsoid is also derived, which illustrates the link between entropy optimization and correlation access and which is exact for a quadratic entropy. The approach enables a simple estimation of the quantum discord. Illustrative results for two-qubit states are discussed.},

We numerically demonstrate that their competition drives an entanglement transition between two distinct steady states that both exhibit area law entanglement, and introduce a classical but non-local model that captures the entanglement dynamics completely. Exploiting a map to bond percolation, we argue that the critical system in one dimension is described by a conformal field theory, and derive the universal scaling of the entanglement entropy and the critical exponent for the scaling of the mutual information of two spins exactly.

We also establish a Markov model for the evolution of the zeroth Renyi entropy and demonstrate that, in one dimension and in the limit of large local dimension, it coincides with the corresponding second-Renyi-entropy model.

  abstract = {The resilience of quantum entanglement to a classicality-inducing environment is tied to fundamental aspects of quantum many-body systems. The dynamics of entanglement has recently been studied in the context of measurement-induced entanglement transitions, where the steady-state entanglement collapses from a volume-law to an area-law at a critical measurement probability \$p\_\{c\}\$. Interestingly, there is a distinction in the value of \$p\_\{c\}\$ depending on how well the underlying unitary dynamics scramble quantum information. For strongly chaotic systems, \$p\_\{c\} {$>$} 0\$, whereas for weakly chaotic systems, such as integrable models, \$p\_\{c\} = 0\$. In this work, we investigate these measurement-induced entanglement transitions in a system where the underlying unitary dynamics are many-body localized (MBL). We demonstrate that the emergent integrability in an MBL system implies a qualitative difference in the nature of the measurement-induced transition depending on the measurement basis, with \$p\_\{c\} {$>$} 0\$ when the measurement basis is scrambled and \$p\_\{c\} = 0\$ when it is not. This feature is not found in Haar-random circuit models, where all local operators are scrambled in time. When the transition occurs at \$p\_\{c\} {$>$} 0\$, we use finite-size scaling to obtain the critical exponent \${\textbackslash}nu = 1.3(2)\$, close to the value for 2+0D percolation. We also find a dynamical critical exponent of \$z = 0.98(4)\$ and logarithmic scaling of the R{\textbackslash}'\{e\}nyi entropies at criticality, suggesting an underlying conformal symmetry at the critical point. This work further demonstrates how the nature of the measurement-induced entanglement transition depends on the scrambling nature of the underlying unitary dynamics. This leads to further questions on the control and simulation of entangled quantum states by measurements in open quantum systems.},

Despite each set yielding the same trajectory averaged density matrix, governed by one Lindblad quantum master equation, we demonstrate significant structural differences in their trajectory statistics. For weak dephasing, the difference remains marginal and we observe subextensive entanglement growth, reminiscent of a critical phase with an emergent conformal invariance. For strong dephasing, however, the dynamics either favors a transition into a quantum Zeno-like area-law regime, or extends the logarithmic growth to arbitrarily strong dephasing rates. This shows that the choice of the trajectory evolution can be essential for the existence of entanglement transitions, and enables the study of unconventional entanglement dynamics in an elementary, physically realistic model for weak continuous measurements.},

However the phase space of a bipartite system must be P(H1 {$\otimes$} H2) and not simply P(H1) {\texttimes} P(H2) as suggested by the analogy with Classical Mechanics. A part of this paper is devoted to manage this problem. In the second part of the work, a definition of quantum entanglement and a proposal of entanglement measure are given in terms of a geometrical point of view (a rather studied topic in recent literature). Finally two known separability criteria are implemented in the Hamiltonian formalism.},

We show that if only near-perfect security is required, the size of the key can be reduced by a factor of two. More specifically, we show that there exists a set of roughly d log d unitary operators whose average effect on every input pure state is almost perfectly randomizing, as compared to the d2 operators required to randomize perfectly. Aside from the private quantum channel, variations of this construction can be applied to many other tasks in quantum information processing. We show, for instance, that it can be used to construct LOCC data hiding schemes for bits and qubits that are much more efficient than any others known, allowing roughly log d qubits to be hidden in 2 log d qubits. The method can also be used to exhibit the existence of quantum states with locked classical correlations, an arbitrarily large amplification of the correlation being accomplished by sending a negligibly small classical key. Our construction also provides the basic building block for a method of remotely preparing arbitrary d-dimensional pure quantum states using approximately log d bits of communication and log d ebits of entanglement.},

The channel is defined by an ``alphabet'' of quantum states, e.g., certain photon polarizations, together with a specified set of probabilities with which these states must be sent. If the receiver is restricted to making separate measurements on the received ``letter'' states, then the Kholevo theorem implies that the amount of information transmitted per letter cannot be greater than the von Neumann entropy H of the letter ensemble. In fact the actual amount of transmitted information will usually be significantly less than H. We show, however, that if the sender uses a block coding scheme consisting of a choice of code words that respects the a priori probabilities of the letter states, and the receiver distinguishes whole words rather than individual letters, then the information transmitted per letter can be made arbitrarily close to H and never exceeds H. This provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation of von Neumann entropy in quantum mechanics. We apply this result to ``superdense'' coding, and we consider its extension to noisy channels. {\textbackslash}textcopyright\{\} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

It allows for entanglement certification when the measurements performed by one of the parties are not characterised (or are untrusted) and has applications in quantum key distribution. Despite its foundational and applied importance, EPR steering lacks a quantitative assessment. Here we propose a way of quantifying this phenomenon and use it to study the steerability of several quantum states. In particular we show that every pure entangled state is maximally steerable, the projector onto the anti-symmetric subspace is maximally steerable for all dimensions, we provide a new example of one-way steering, and give strong support that states with positive-partial-transposition are not steerable.},

Here, we introduce a method to approximate such entropic quantities. Applied to the setting of device-independent randomness generation and quantum key distribution, we obtain improvements on protocol rates in various settings. In particular, we find new upper bounds on the minimal global detection efficiency required to perform device-independent quantum key distribution without additional preprocessing. Furthermore, we show that our construction can be readily combined with the entropy accumulation theorem in order to establish full finite-key security proofs for these protocols. Simple lower bounds on the rates of device-independent quantum information protocols can often overestimate the power of the eavesdropping party. Here, the authors use new entropic quantities defined as semidefinite programs to improve bounds in several regimes without expensive computational resources},

Dissipative phase transitions in steady states of time-independent Liouvillians and measurement induced phase transitions at the level of quantum trajectories are two primary examples of such transitions. Investigating a many-body spin system subject to periodic resetting measurements, we argue that many-body dissipative Floquet dynamics provides a natural framework to analyze both types of transitions. We show that a dissipative phase transition between a ferromagnetic ordered phase and a paramagnetic disordered phase emerges for long range systems as a function of measurement probabilities. A measurement induced transition of the entanglement entropy between volume law scaling and area law scaling is also present, and is distinct from the ordering transition. The ferromagnetic phase is lost for short range interactions, while the volume law phase of the entanglement is enhanced. An analysis of multifractal properties of wave function in Hilbert space provides a common perspective on both types of transitions in the system. Our findings are immediately relevant to trapped ion experiments, for which we detail a blueprint proposal based on currently available platforms.},

Most known examples can be understood as some classical ordering transitions in an underlying statistical mechanics model, where entanglement maps onto the free energy cost of inserting a domain wall. In this paper, we study the possibility of entanglement transitions driven by physics beyond such statistical mechanics mappings. Motivated by recent applications of neural network-inspired variational Ansatze, we investigate under what conditions on the variational parameters these Ansatze can capture an entanglement transition. We study the entanglement scaling of short-range restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) quantum states with random phases. For uncorrelated random phases, we analytically demonstrate the absence of an entanglement transition and reveal subtle finite size effects in finite size numerical simulations. Introducing phases with correlations decaying as \$1/r{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ in real space, we observe three regions with a different scaling of entanglement entropy depending on the exponent \${\textbackslash}alpha\$. We study the nature of the transition between these regions, finding numerical evidence for critical behavior. Our work establishes the presence of long-range correlated phases in RBM-based wave functions as a required ingredient for entanglement transitions.},

Non-local theories rely on two fundamental effects: local uncertainty relations and steering of physical states at a distance. In quantum mechanics, the former one dominates the other in a well-known class of non-local games known as XOR games. In particular, optimal quantum strategies for XOR games are completely determined by the uncertainty principle alone. This breakthrough result has yielded the fundamental open question whether optimal quantum strategies are always restricted by local uncertainty principles, with entanglement-based steering playing no role. In this work, we provide a negative answer to the question, showing that both steering and uncertainty relations play a fundamental role in determining optimal quantum strategies for non-local games.

Unlike previous constructions, the graph is regular and is also a universal resource for measurement based quantum computing, closely related to the brickwork state},

In the spirit of random matrix theory, we describe a simple model for such transitions where a physical quantum many-body system lives at the "holographic" boundary of a bulk random tensor network. Using a replica trick approach, we map the calculation of the entanglement properties of the boundary system onto the free energy cost of fluctuating domain walls in a classical statistical mechanics model. This allows us to interpret transitions between volume-law and area-law scaling of entanglement as ordering transitions in this statistical mechanics model. Our approach allows us to get an analytic handle on the field theory of these entanglement transitions.},

In one phase, a finite fraction of the system belongs to a fully-entangled state, one for which no subsystem is in a pure state, while in the second phase, the steady-state is a product state over extensively many, finite subsystems. We study this "separability" transition in a family of solvable models in which we analytically determine the transition point, the evolution of certain entanglement properties of interest, and relate this to a mean-field percolation transition. Since the entanglement entropy density does not distinguish these phases, we introduce the entangling power - which measures whether local measurements outside of two finite subsystems can boost their mutual information - as an order parameter, after considering its behavior in tensor network states, and numerically studying its behavior in a model of Clifford dynamics with measurements. We argue that in our models, the separability transition coincides with a transition in the computational "hardness" of classically determining the output probability distribution for the steady-state in a certain basis of product states. A prediction for this distribution, which is accurate in the separable phase, and should deviate from the true distribution in the fully-entangled phase, provides a possible benchmarking task for quantum computers.},

Beyond being of fundamental interest, this offers significant advantages for quantum information processing. The problem of certifying these stronger correlations, however, remains an important challenge, in particular in an experimental setting. Here we theoretically formalise and experimentally demonstrate a notion of genuine high-dimensional quantum nonlocal steering. We show that high-dimensional entanglement combined with judiciously chosen local measurements can lead to a stronger form of steering, provably impossible to obtain via entanglement in lower dimensions. Exploiting the connection between steering and incompatibility of quantum measurements, we derive simple two-setting steering inequalities for certifying the presence of genuine high-dimensional steering. We report the experimental violation of these inequalities using macro-pixel photon-pair entanglement certifying genuine high-dimensional steering in dimensions up to \$d=15\$. Our work paves the way for the characterisation and certification of quantum nonlocal correlations in high-dimensional systems.},

We consider an arbitrary number \$L\$ of environments to which the system is coupled, and an arbitrary number \$K\$ of different types of dyne detections. We prove that nontrivial necessary conditions for such a demonstration can be determined efficiently by semidefinite programming. To determine sufficient conditions, different physical environmental couplings and Hamiltonians for a qubit and different sets of diffusive monitorings are scrutinized. We compare the threshold efficiencies that are sufficient in the various cases, as well as cases previously considered in the literature, to suggest the most feasible experimental options.},

We demonstrate the emergence of GinUE firstly in translational invariant (TI) MBQC systems, which can be associated with dual transfer matrices with complex-valued spectra, before generalizing to spatially-random systems. We argue and demonstrate that the dual spectra of TI MBQC systems necessarily have non-trivial and universal correlations due to the existence of a linear ramp in the spectral form factor (SFF). We show that, firstly, the spectral statistics of the dual spectra, probed by the dissipative spectral form factor and spacing distribution, falls under the universality class of the GinUE, and in particular displays level repulsion in the complex plane. Secondly, we obtain an exact analytical expression of SFF for the GinUE, and show that it universally describes the SFF of TI MBQC systems in the scaling limit where \$t\$ and \$L\$ are large, while the ratio between \$L\$ and \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Th\}\}\$, the many body Thouless length is fixed. Thirdly, we propose variations of Ginibre models accounting for time periodicity, such that the SFF of Floquet MBQC (with or without TI) can be analytically described, thereby removing the necessity of TI for the emergence of GinUE. Lastly, we remark that locality and the many-body nature of MBQC systems are required for the emergence of the GinUE in large system sizes.},

Since physical systems are unavoidably coupled to environment, quantum noise, which can qualitatively modify or even destroy certain entanglement structure, needs to be considered in analyzing a system with MIPT. In this Letter, we investigate the effect of quantum noise modeled by a reset quantum channel acting on each site with a probability \$q\$ on MIPT. Based on the numerical results from Clifford circuits, we show that the quantum noise can qualitatively change the entanglement properties---the entanglement obeys ``area law'' instead of ``volume law'' with a measurement rate \$p\&lt;\{p\}\_\{c\}\$. In the noise-induced area law phase, the entanglement exhibits a novel \$\{q\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ensuremath\{-\}1/3\}\$ power-law scaling. Using an analytic mapping from the quantum model to a classical statistical model, we further show that the area law entanglement is the consequence of noise-driven symmetry-breaking field, and the \$\{q\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ensuremath\{-\}1/3\}\$ scaling can be understood as the result of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations of directed polymer with an effective length scale \$\{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}{\textbackslash}ensuremath\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\{q\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ensuremath\{-\}1\}\$ in a random environment.},

  abstract = {The field of classical stochastic processes forms a major branch of mathematics. They are, of course, also very well studied in biology, chemistry, ecology, geology, finance, physics, and many more fields of natural and social sciences. When it comes to quantum stochastic processes, however, the topic is plagued with pathological issues that have led to fierce debates amongst researchers. Recent developments have begun to untangle these issues and paved the way for generalizing the theory of classical stochastic processes to the quantum domain without ambiguities. This tutorial details the structure of quantum stochastic processes, in terms of the modern language of quantum combs, and is aimed at students in quantum physics and quantum information theory. We begin with the basics of classical stochastic processes and generalize the same ideas to the quantum domain. Along the way, we discuss the subtle structure of quantum physics that has led to troubles in forming an overarching theory for quantum stochastic processes. We close the tutorial by laying out many exciting problems that lie ahead in this branch of science.},

  abstract = {The rise of programmable quantum devices has motivated the exploration of circuit models which could realize novel physics. A promising candidate is a class of hybrid circuits, where entangling unitary dynamics compete with disentangling measurements. Novel phase transitions between different entanglement regimes have been identified in their dynamical states, with universal properties hinting at unexplored critical phenomena. Trapped ion hardware is a leading contender for the experimental realization of such physics, which requires not only traditional two-qubit entangling gates, but a constant rate of local measurements accurately addressed throughout the circuit. Recent progress in engineering high-precision optical addressing of individual ions makes preparing a constant rate of measurements throughout a unitary circuit feasible. Using tensor network simulations, we show that the resulting class of hybrid circuits, prepared with native gates, exhibits a volume-law to area-law transition in the entanglement entropy. This displays universal hallmarks of a measurement-induced phase transition. Our simulations are able to characterize the critical exponents using circuit sizes with tens of qubits and thousands of gates. We argue that this transition should be robust against additional sources of experimental noise expected in modern trapped ion hardware, and will rather be limited by statistical requirements on post selection. Our work highlights the powerful role that tensor network simulations can play in advancing the theoretical and experimental frontiers of critical phenomena.},

In the bipartite setting, it hinges on the question of whether Alice can affect Bob's state at a distance through her choice of measurement. More precisely and operationally, it hinges on the question of whether Alice, with classical communication, can convince Bob that they share an entangled state under the circumstances that Bob trusts nothing that Alice says. We argue that if she can, then this demonstrates the nonlocal effect first identified in the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper [Phys. Rev. 47, 777 (1935)] as a universal effect for pure entangled states. This ability of Alice to remotely prepare Bob's state was subsequently called steering by Schrodinger, whose terminology we adopt. The phenomenon of steering has been largely overlooked, and prior to our work had not even been given a rigorous definition that is applicable to mixed states as well as pure states. Armed with our rigorous definition, we proved that steerable states are a strict subset of the entangled states, and a strict superset of the states that can exhibit Bell nonlocality. In this work we expand on these results and provide further examples of steerable states. We also elaborate on the connection with the original EPR paradox.},

Here we consider the somewhat simpler task of demonstrating Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering with a single photon (also without postselection). We demonstrate that Alice's choice of measurement on her portion of the entangled state can affect Bob's portion of the entangled state in his laboratory, in a sense rigorously defined by us and Doherty [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 140402 (2007)]. Previous work by Lvovsky and coworkers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 047903 (2004)] has addressed this phenomenon (which they called remote preparation) experimentally using homodyne measurements on a single photon. Here we show that, unfortunately, their experimental parameters do not meet the bounds necessary for a rigorous demonstration of EPR steering with a single photon. However, we also show that modest improvements in the experimental parameters, and the addition of photon counting to the arsenal of Alice's measurements, would be sufficient to allow such a demonstration.},

In the present work, we examine the effect of global unitary operations on the conditional entropy of the system. We start with the set containing states with non-negative conditional entropy and find that some states preserve the non-negativity under unitary operations on the composite system. We call this class of states as Absolute Conditional von Neumann entropy Non Negative class ({\textbackslash}textbf\{ACVENN\}). We are able to characterize such states for \$2{\textbackslash}otimes 2\$ dimensional systems. On a different perspective the characterization accentuates the detection of states whose conditional entropy becomes negative after the global unitary action. Interestingly, we are able to show that this {\textbackslash}textbf\{ACVENN\} class of states forms a set which is convex and compact. This feature enables for the existence of hermitian witness operators the measurement of which could distinguish unknown states which will have negative conditional entropy after the global unitary operation. This has immediate application in super dense coding and state merging as negativity of conditional entropy plays a key role in both these information processing tasks. Some illustrations are also provided to probe the connection of such states with Absolute separable (AS) states and Absolute local (AL) states.},

These are called 2-unitaries and are examples of perfect tensors that can be used to construct absolutely maximally entangled states. Hitherto no systematic methods exist, in all local dimensions, which result in the formation of such special classes of unitary operators.

By considering any conceivable measurement scheme, we derive a necessary criterion for the measurement interpretation of both equations. Concrete examples show that the normalized linear NMQSD solutions are realizable only in the Markovian limit in general. The application of the presented criterion to the nonlinear NMQSD remains an open issue. Furthermore, this criterion is a necessary one not only in the context of the NMQSDs but also for a much broader class of stochastic Schrodinger equations.},

As a concrete example, one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model is simulated by using matrix product state and time evolving block decimation. We map out a global phase diagram in terms of the measurement rate in spatial space and time domain, which demonstrates a volume-to-area law entanglement phase transition. When the measurement rates reach the critical values, we observe a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy as the sub-system size or evolved time increases. This is akin to the character in the many-body localization, implying a general picture of the dynamical transitions separating quantum systems with different entanglement features. Moreover, we find that the probability distribution of the single-site entanglement entropy distinguishes the volume and area law phases just as the case of disorder-induced many-body localization. This suggests that the different type entanglement phase transitions may be understood as a nonlocalized-to-localized transition. We also investigate the scaling behavior of entanglement entropy and mutual information between two separated intervals, which is indicative of a single universality class and thus suggests a possible unified description of this transition.},

At least one of the states can be eliminated from the set by reducing its weight to zero via a simple transformation of the density matrix. When there are degenerate weights, the transformation is applied using the weight with the largest degeneracy. Thus, even if none of the original statistical weights are equal to zero, so that rank( r)5n, the system can be described by a set of m states with m,n. The resulting minimal set provides a concommitant increase in calculational efficiency that depends on the fractional degeneracy. The independent evolution of the states comprising the set also provides an inherent parallelism that can be readily utilized in numerical computations. In addition to efficiency and conceptual simplification, this decomposition can provide physical insight, since the explicit contribution of each pure state to the dynamics of the system is readily apparent.},

In this paper, we derive the limit to the measurement efficiency of a superconducting persistent-current qubit measured by a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and calculate the noise transmitted to the qubit from the environment of the dc SQUID. The method, with simple linear circuitry correspondence, can be applied to calculate the noise transferred to a quantum system from the environment of an arbitrary external system that interacts with it. The relaxation and decoherence induced by this noise are also estimated.},

We demonstrate explicitly the emergence of a `minimal membrane' governing entanglement growth, which in 1+1D is a directed random walk in spacetime (or a variant thereof). Using the replica trick to handle the logarithm in the definition of the \$n\$th R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropy \$S\_n\$, we map the calculation of the entanglement after a quench to a problem of interacting random walks. For the second R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropy, \$S\_2\$, we are able to take the replica limit explicitly. This gives a mapping between entanglement growth and a directed polymer in a random medium at finite temperature (confirming KPZ scaling for entanglement growth in generic noisy systems). We find that the entanglement growth rate (`speed') \$v\_n\$ depends on the R{\textbackslash}'enyi index \$n\$, and we calculate \$v\_2\$ and \$v\_3\$ in an expansion in the inverse local Hilbert space dimension, \$1/q\$. These rates are determined by the free energy of a random walk, and of a bound state of two random walks, respectively, and include contributions of `energetic' and `entropic' origin. We give a combinatorial interpretation of the Page-like subleading corrections to the entanglement at late times and discuss the dynamics of the entanglement close to and after saturation. We briefly discuss the application of these insights to time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics.},

These tractable systems involve an average over random local unitaries defining the dynamical evolution. We show here how to make sense of this membrane in more realistic models, which do not involve an average over random unitaries. Our approach relies on introducing effective pairing degrees of freedom in spacetime, inspired by the structure emerging in random unitary circuits. We apply this approach to some translationally invariant Floquet spin chains studied in the literature. We show that a consistent line tension may be defined for the entanglement membrane, and that there are qualitative differences in this tension between generic models and ``dual-unitary'' circuits. These results allow scaling pictures for out-of-time-order correlators and for entanglement to be taken over from random circuits to non-random Floquet models. We also provide an efficient numerical algorithm for determining the entanglement line tension in 1+1D.},

In particular, we consider sets of deterministic sparse couplings that naturally interpolate between local circuits that slowly scramble information and highly nonlocal circuits that achieve the fast-scrambling limit. We find that circuits featuring sparse nonlocal interactions are able to withstand substantially higher rates of local measurement than circuits with only local interactions, even at comparable gate depths. We also study the quantum error-correcting codes that support the volume-law entangled phase and find that our maximally nonlocal circuits yield codes with nearly extensive contiguous code distance. Use of these sparse, deterministic circuits opens pathways towards the design of noise-resilient quantum circuits and error correcting codes in current and future quantum devices with minimum gate numbers.},

We propose a way of characterising common-cause assemblages from the correlations that arise when the trusted party performs tomographicallycomplete measurements on their share of the experiment, and discuss the advantages and challenges of this approach. Within this framework, we show that so-called almost quantum assemblages satisfy the principle of macroscopic noncontextuality, and demonstrate that a subset of almost quantum correlations recover almost quantum assemblages in this approach.},

That is, the reduced density matrix is universal in the sense that it depends only on S's Hamiltonian and the temperature but not on B's Hamiltonian, on the interaction Hamiltonian, or on the details of {$\Psi$}. It has also been pointed out that S can also be attributed a random wave function {$\psi$} whose probability distribution is universal in the same sense. This distribution is known as the ``Scrooge measure'' or ``Gaussian adjusted projected (GAP) measure''; we regard it as the thermal equilibrium distribution of wave functions. The relevant concept of the wave function of a subsystem is known as the ``conditional wave function.'' In this paper, we develop analogous considerations for particles with spin. One can either use some kind of conditional wave function or, more naturally, the ``conditional density matrix,'' which is in general different from the reduced density matrix. We ask what the thermal equilibrium distribution of the conditional density matrix is, and find the answer that for most {$\Psi$} the conditional density matrix is (approximately) deterministic, in fact (approximately) equal to the canonical density matrix.},

In general, even for a system with a finite Hilbert space dimension \$D\$, the pure state trajectory will explore an infinite number of points in Hilbert space, meaning that the dimension \$K\$ of the classical memory required for the tracking is infinite. However, Karasik and Wiseman [Phys. Rev. Lett., 106(2):020406, 2011] showed that tracking of a qubit (\$D=2\$) is always possible with a bit (\$K=2\$), and gave a heuristic argument implying that a finite \$K\$ should be sufficient for any \$D\$, although beyond \$D=2\$ it would be necessary to have \$K{$>$}D\$. Our paper is concerned with rigorously investigating the relationship between \$D\$ and \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}\$, the smallest feasible \$K\$. We confirm the long-standing conjecture of Karasik and Wiseman that, for generic systems with \$D{$>$}2\$, \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}{$>$}D\$, by a computational proof (via Hilbert Nullstellensatz certificates of infeasibility). That is, beyond \$D=2\$, \$D\$-dimensional open quantum systems are provably harder to track than \$D\$-dimensional open classical systems. Moreover, we develop, and better justify, a new heuristic to guide our expectation of \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}\$ as a function of \$D\$, taking into account the number \$L\$ of Lindblad operators as well as symmetries in the problem. The use of invariant subspace and Wigner symmetries makes it tractable to conduct a numerical search, using the method of polynomial homotopy continuation, to find finite physically realizable ensembles (as they are known) in \$D=3\$. The results of this search support our heuristic. We thus have confidence in the most interesting feature of our heuristic: in the absence of symmetries, \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm min\} {\textbackslash}sim D{\textasciicircum}2\$, implying a quadratic gap between the classical and quantum tracking problems.},

We rigorously show that the ensemble, derived for a class of quantum chaotic systems undergoing quench dynamics, approaches a universal form completely independent of system details: it becomes uniformly distributed in Hilbert space. This goes beyond the standard paradigm of quantum thermalization, which dictates that the subsystem relaxes to an ensemble of quantum states that reproduces the expectation values of local observables in a thermal mixed state. Our results imply more generally that the distribution of quantum states themselves becomes indistinguishable from those of uniformly random ones, i.e., the ensemble forms a quantum state design in the parlance of quantum information theory. Our work establishes bridges between quantum many-body physics, quantum information and random matrix theory, by showing that pseudorandom states can arise from isolated quantum dynamics, opening up new ways to design applications for quantum state tomography and benchmarking.},

  abstract = {Abstract   The state matrix  {$\rho$}  for an open quantum system with Markovian evolution obeys a master equation. The master equation evolution can be  unraveled  into stochastic nonlinear trajectories for a pure state  P , such that on average  P  reproduces  {$\rho$} . Here we give for the first time a complete parameterization of all diffusive unravelings (in which  P  evolves continuously but non-differentiably in time). We give an explicit measurement theory interpretation for these quantum trajectories, in terms of monitoring the system's environment. We also introduce new classes of diffusive unravelings that are invariant under the linear operator transformations under which the master equation is invariant. We illustrate these invariant unravelings by numerical simulations. Finally, we discuss generalized gauge transformations as a method of connecting apparently disparate descriptions of the same trajectories by stochastic Schrodinger equations, and their invariance properties.},

Some, but not all, ensembles are PR. This constitutes the preferred ensemble fact. We present the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given ensemble to be PR, and illustrate the method by showing that the coherent state ensemble is not PR for an atom laser.},

  abstract = {In this paper we continue to explore "hybrid" quantum circuit models in one-dimension with both unitary and measurement gates, focussing on the entanglement properties of wavefunction trajectories at long times, in the steady state. We simulate a large class of Clifford circuits, including models with or without randomness in the unitary gates, and with or without randomness in the locations of measurement gates, using stabilizer techniques to access the long time dynamics of systems up to 512 qubits. In all models we find a volume law entangled phase for low measurement rates, which exhibits a sub-dominant logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy, S\_A = \{{\textbackslash}alpha\} ln {\textbar}A{\textbar} + s{\textbar}A{\textbar}, with sub-system size {\textbar}A{\textbar}. With increasing measurement rate the volume law phase is unstable to a disentangled area law phase, passing through a single entanglement transition at a critical rate of measurement. At criticality we find a purely logarithmic entanglement entropy, S\_A = \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}(p\_c) ln{\textbar}A{\textbar}, a power law decay and conformal symmetry of the mutual information, with exponential decay off criticality. Various spin-spin correlation functions also show slow decay at criticality, providing possible experimental access. Critical exponents are consistent across all models, indicative of a single universality class. These results suggest the existence of an effective underlying statistical mechanical model for the entanglement transition. Beyond Clifford circuit models, numerical simulations of up to 20 qubits give consistent results.},

  abstract = {We present a theory of the entanglement transition tuned by measurement strength in qudit chains evolved by random unitary circuits and subject to either weak or random projective measurements. The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher information. To compute the von{\textasciitilde}Neumann entanglement entropy \$S\$ and the Fisher information \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities \${\textbackslash}tilde\{S\}{\textasciicircum}\{(n)\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}{\textasciicircum}\{(n)\}\$ that depend on the \$n\$-th moments of density matrices and reduce to \$S\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$ in the limit \$n{\textbackslash}to 1\$. These quantities with \$n{\textbackslash}ge 2\$ are mapped to free energies of a classical spin model with \$n!\$ internal states in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, \${\textbackslash}tilde\{S\}{\textasciicircum}\{(n)\}\$ is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}{\textasciicircum}\{(n)\}\$ is related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension \$q\$ followed by the replica limit \$n{\textbackslash}to 1\$, we obtain the critical measurement probability \$p\_c=1/2\$ and identify the transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum dynamics.},

Ensemble of non-unitary dynamics of a chaotic many-body system with measurements exhibits a purification phase transition. We numerically find that the law of the increase dynamics of the purity changes by projective measurements in the model. In order to study this behavior in detail, we construct the formalism of the tripartite mutual information (TMI) for non-unitary time evolution operator by using the state-channel map. The numerical result of the saturation value of the TMI indicates the existence of a measurement-induced phase transition. This implies the existence of two distinct phases, mixed phase and purified phase. Furthermore, the real-space spread of the TMI is investigated to explore spatial patterns of information spreading. Even in the purified phase, the spatial pattern of the light cone spread of quantum information is not deformed, but its density of information propagation is reduced on average by the projective measurements. We also find that this spatial pattern of the TMI distinguishes the chaotic and integrable regimes of the system.},

Defying the complications imposed by the non-linear and stochastic nature of the measurement process, we introduce a scenario of measurement-induced many body evolution, which possesses an exact analytical solution: bosonic Gaussian measurements. The evolution features a competition between the continuous observation of linear boson operators and a free Hamiltonian, and it is characterized by a unique and exactly solvable covariance matrix. Within this framework, we then consider an elementary model for quantum criticality, the free boson conformal field theory, and investigate in which way criticality is modified under measurements. Depending on the measurement protocol, we distinguish three fundamental scenarios (a) enriched quantum criticality, characterized by a logarithmic entanglement growth with a floating prefactor, or the loss of criticality, indicated by an entanglement growth with either (b) an area-law or (c) a volume-law. For each scenario, we discuss the impact of imperfect measurements, which reduce the purity of the wavefunction and are equivalent to Markovian decoherence, and present a set of observables, e.g., real-space correlations, the relaxation time, and the entanglement structure, to classify the measurement-induced dynamics for both pure and mixed states. Finally, we present an experimental tomography scheme, which grants access to the density operator of the system by using the continuous measurement record only.},

We extract estimates for the associated bulk critical exponents that are consistent with the values for percolation, as well as those for stabilizer circuits, but differ from previous estimates for the Haar-random case. Our estimates of the surface order parameter exponent appear different from those for stabilizer circuits or percolation, but we cannot definitively rule out the scenario where all exponents in the three cases match. Moreover, in the Haar case the prefactor for the entanglement entropies {$Sn$} depends strongly on the R{\'e}nyi index {$n$}; for stabilizer circuits and percolation this dependence is absent. Results on stabilizer circuits are used to guide our study and identify measures with weak finite-size effects. We discuss how our numerical estimates constrain theories of the transition.},
