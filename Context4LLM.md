# Project Context for LLM Collaboration:

You are working on the Physics Literature Synthesis Pipeline, an AI-powered academic writing and research assistant specifically designed to help physics researchers write papers and engage in sophisticated scientific discussions. 

The primary goal is to create an intelligent research companion that can assist with the entire academic writing process—from literature review and concept development to manuscript drafting and scientific argumentation—by maintaining deep awareness of the researcher's personal literature collection and the broader physics knowledge base. 

The system automatically builds comprehensive knowledge bases from researchers' Zotero libraries, personal publications, and current drafts, using advanced semantic embeddings to enable the AI assistant to understand context, cite relevant sources, and provide scientifically grounded responses during research conversations. 

The literature acquisition components (Zotero integration, DOI-based PDF downloads, publisher automation) exist primarily to ensure the AI assistant has access to the most complete and current collection of papers possible, automatically expanding the knowledge base as new literature becomes available. Ideally, when researchers ask questions about quantum error correction, discuss theoretical frameworks, or need help drafting sections of papers, the AI should be able to correctly draw upon the curated knowledge base to provide responses that reference specific papers, suggest relevant citations, help synthesize conflicting viewpoints in the literature, and even assist with technical writing by understanding the researcher's previous work and writing style. This is very much work-in-progress and it needs to be improved-upon.

The system is designed for the deep, iterative conversations that characterize serious academic work—helping researchers think through complex problems, explore connections between different areas of physics, develop arguments for papers, and maintain scientific rigor by always grounding discussions in the actual literature rather than relying solely on the AI's training data.

# Project Architecture

The codebase is organized into a modular Python package with clear separation of concerns: the src/core/ module handles document processing (PDF/LaTeX text extraction) and embedding generation for semantic search; `src/downloaders/` contains an inheritance hierarchy where `ZoteroLibraryManager` provides basic API operations and `EnhancedZoteroLibraryManager` adds browser automation for DOI-based PDF downloads, with `EnhancedZoteroLiteratureSyncer` orchestrating high-level workflows; `src/chat/` implements the AI research assistant with ChatInterface for basic conversation management and `LiteratureAssistant` for literature-aware interactions that integrate semantic search with Claude AI responses; `config/` centralizes configuration management with environment variable support; and `src/utils/` provides shared utilities for logging and file operations. 

The system uses a three-tier data flow: literature acquisition (Zotero sync → DOI downloads → PDF integration), knowledge base building (document processing → text chunking → embedding generation), and AI interaction (semantic search → context building → Claude API → source-backed responses). The architecture follows the factory pattern for component creation, strategy pattern for publisher-specific downloads, and facade pattern for simplified user interfaces, with graceful degradation ensuring core functionality remains available when optional dependencies like Selenium are missing. All configuration is managed through a centralized `PipelineConfig` class that validates API keys, handles environment variables, and provides component-specific configuration getters, while maintaining backwards compatibility and supporting both development and production deployment scenarios.
